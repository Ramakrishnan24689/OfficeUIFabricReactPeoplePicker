# PeoplePicker Instructions

## ChangeLog

* Modified code to handle querying any entity type. Custom coded it to handle accounts, users, customers, and teams as well.
* Modified it to handle disabled/readonly. Before if you opened an deactivated record - it would still allow editing
* Modified it to pass third parameter back as part of the object - entityName. Is useful for parsing data for reports/etc.
* Added buildscript to automate the build process. Just need to open PowerShell as admin, navigate to buildscript.ps1 and then type that in and press enter. It will clean up previous files and build/run all necessary steps once you have the initial setup done.
